    <h1>Polyphia</h1>
    <p>
      Polyphia is a primarily instrumental progressive rock band based in Plano, Texas, formed in 2010. The group consists of guitarists Tim Henson and Scott LePage, bassist Clay Gober, and drummer Clay Aeschliman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polyphia's sound is noted for incorporating virtuosic guitar parts with other styles of music. Initially rooted in a metal-focused tone in their early releases, they developed their music into a more progressive rock sound, combining electronic music and hip hop in their later productions. Polyphia has released four studio albums, two EPs, and numerous singles. Their fourth album, Remember That You Will Die, released in October 2022, was the first to chart, debuting at number 33 on the Billboard 200.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      "Polyphia" comes from the word "Polyphony", meaning "music whose texture is defined by the interweaving of several melodic lines". Playing off this definition, as a band, we capitalize on musicianship and that, musically, each member of the band is a cornerstone of our sound. We stray from the idea of a one-dimensional, vocal-centered, or guitar-centered, or drum-centered group, and let each member of the band play an integral part in the overall product. As a people, all of us have a unique and personal identity that makes us dynamic and purposeful, and our band means to convey this quality within all of us through our music; never diminishing the potential of others and thriving in unity
    </p>

    <h2>Style and influences</h2>
    <p>
      The band initially became popular on YouTube for making guitar covers of hit songs, and their debut EP “Inspire” showed that they were mostly influenced by pop music. They became more metal-oriented in their following songs, and were soon associated with the progressive metal sub-genre called Djent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after their second LP “Renaissance” that they were branded as a progressive rock band, while Polyphia then began mixing funk, hip-hop and EDM elements in their new songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band's fourth studio album, Remember That You Will Die, has continued in this vein, further exploring "trap percussion and hip hop stylings", as well as incorporating a variety of genres, such as bubblegum pop and bossa nova.
